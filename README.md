# Project - Andela Office Space Allocation  

When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space if
they choose to opt in.
When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only.
This project will digitize and randomize a room allocation system for one of
Andela Kenyaâ€™s facilities called The Dojo.
This system will be used to automatically allocate spaces to people at random.
